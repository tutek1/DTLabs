# Lab04 - 2D Platformer in 3D

## Overview TODO
Duration: hh:mm:ss

This lab will combine the 2D minigame created in the previous lab with the 3D game we were making before. We will look at how to use `SubViewports` and how to stop and resume a subtree (the 2D game).

Today we will look over:
- See the **changes** I made from the last lab
- Saving the **2D player scene**
- TODO


Here is the template for this lab. Please download it, there are new scenes and folders.

## Save the Player2D
Duration: hh:mm:ss

I created a template level, which will work as a base scene to be duplicated to create more 2D platforming levels and it can be found in folder `2DPlatforming/Levels/`







## Recap TODO
Duration: hh:mm:ss

Let's look at what we did in this lab.
- We looked at **project organization** and folder management
- Then we learned what **sprite sheets** are and how to setup a `TileSet` from one
- We used the created `TileSet` in a `TileMapLayer` and drew an **environment**
- Next I tasked you to create a **2D player controller**
- Then we made the **jump pad** functional using the `Linear Velocity` property in tiles
- We added **electric cables**, which reset the level on touch, while learning about **Custom Data** in tiles and how to get them.
- Lastly, we set up the camera to **correctly scale** with the window size
