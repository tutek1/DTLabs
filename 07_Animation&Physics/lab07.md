# Lab07 - Animation & Physics

## Overview TODO
Duration: hh:mm:ss

This lab will focus on learning about **Behavior Trees** as an alternative for **Finite-State Machines**. We will recreate the behavior of the **Ground Enemy Finite-State Machine** from the last lab using a Behavior Tree.

Then we will learn about **Steering Behaviors** as an less robust but more interesting alternative for **Navigational Meshes** (NavMesh). We will use the new enemy **Air Enemy** to try out the Steering Behaviors, while implementing some of them.

In a bullet point format, we will:
- Learn the theory behind **Behavior Trees**. 
- Install the **`Beehave`** plugin** and set it up.
- Reimplement the **`Ground Enemy` behavior** using Behavior Trees.
- Learn the theory behind **Steering Behaviors**. 
- Implement **`Seek`** and **`Pursue`** behavior.
- Try out all the other **steering behaviors** I prepared.

Here is the template for this lab. Please download it, there are scripts, models, and scenes needed for the Behavior Trees and Steering Behaviors.

## Behavior Trees (BT)
Duration: hh:mm:ss


## Recap TODO
Duration: hh:mm:ss

Let's look at what we did in this lab.
- We learned about **Behavior Trees** and installed the plugin `Beehave`.
- Then, we **implemented the `Patrol`** behavior of the `GroundEnemy` to match the `FSM` variant.
- Next, we **implemented the `Chase`** behavior of the `GroundEnemy` to match the `FSM` variant.
- In order to do the two steps above we learned about **composite, decorator,** and **leaf nodes**.
- Lastly, we **added the shooting and tweens**, that the `FSM` variant of the enemy also does.
- With Behavior Trees covered we looked into the **theory** of **Steering Behaviors**
- Then, we looked at the `AirEnemy` and how is **Steering** implemented in the code
- We got our hands dirty by programming the **`Seek & Pursue`** behaviors.
- Lastly we looked at other **Steering Behaviors**:
    - **Arrive**
    - **Collision Avoidance**
    - My own: **Hover**

### Note on AI in games
As we saw, you can create an AI for your game in about a **million different ways**. In the end it all depends on the behavior that you are trying to achieve with your game. Each game can have **different restrictions**, that you need to take into account, whether it be the visual style/theme of the game, performance, or ease of use by the designers.

### A better plugin
If you are interested in a more robust plugin for your game, I recommend **LimboAI** ([GitHub](https://github.com/limbonaut/limboai)). It implements `FSM` and `Behavior Trees` in a very efficient way with interesting visual tools for debugging.
