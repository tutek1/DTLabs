This is a bonus lab that will list **other tutorials** in video or other forms. You can treat it as a **library of extra materials**, where you can find good tutorials on selected topics. This library will **grow with time**, so be sure to **check it out when searching** for help.

The materials are split up into **sections** based on the topic.

### How to program in Godot - GDScript Tutorial
An **extensive overview** of the whole `GDScript` programming language. From simple **data types** and **loops** to **signals**, **classes**, **inheritance**, and **node concepts** such as "call down, signal up".

<video id=e1zJS31tr88></video>

> aside positive
> I recommend this video for a **quick lookup** on a coding topic or a **full overview**, so that you know what is at your disposal when using Godot.


### Fixing Rookie Mistakes in Godot
In depth into **best practices**, **common mistakes**, and **coding**. It does so though fixing an already existing simple `Asteroids` game made in **Godot**.

<video id=uA2qqLrf_5Y></video>

> aside positive
> This video is an interesting look at how programming differs based on the **experience of the programmer**.


### Godot Singletons
An introduction into **Autoloads** in **Godot**. Shows how to create **autoload manager** nodes and takes a brief overview of other programming patterns.

<video id=ske-iL4mxdI></video>

> aside positive
> Useful for getting to know common programming patterns, mainly `Singletons`.


### Custom Resources

#### Custom Resource are a MUST KNOW in Godot | Complete Tutorial
Provides a complete **overview** of `Resources`, how they **can be used**, how you can **create your own** `Custom Resources`, and why they are a **powerful tool** that should be used.

<video id=zbAKzM-Odb4></video>

> aside positive
> I suggest this video if the concept of `Resouces` in **Godot** is still **unclear to you**.

#### Custom Resources - A Godot Workflow GAME CHANGER
This video is similar to the last one but only 4 minutes in length, giving a very fast but more visual overview on how to use `Custom Resources`.

<video id=vzRZjM9MTGw></video>

> aside positive
> I recommend this video to **almost everyone**, since you never know how could `Custom Resources` help you develop your game.




## Math Materials
Duration: hh:mm:ss

### An In-Depth look at Lerp, Smoothstep, and Shaping Functions
Not a **Godot** video per se but dives into **linear interpolation** and related **mathematical concepts**, which is important for game development.

<video id=YJB1QnEmlTs></video>

> aside positive
> I recommend this video if you are s**truggling to understand** or **use** linear interpolation and easing (shaping) functions.


### What Kind of Math Should Game Developers Know?
A brief overview of the **basic math needed for developing games**. Topics include: **Lerp**, **Angles**, **Trigonometry**, **Matrices**, **Gimbal Lock**, and **Quaternions**. Includes a quick look at linear interpolation from the video above.


<video id=eRVRioN4GwA></video>

> aside positive
> This video is mostly for people struggling with the **math side of game development** or if you need a **refresher**.

## Feedback
Duration: hh:mm:ss

Even in this extra codelab I would be very grateful if you could take a moment to fill out a **very short feedback form** (it takes less than a minute). Your feedback will prove very useful for my master's thesis, where I will use it to evaluate the work I have done.
